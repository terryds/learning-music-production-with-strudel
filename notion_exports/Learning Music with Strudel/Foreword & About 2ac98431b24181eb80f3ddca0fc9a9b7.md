# Foreword & About

## Free course in making music directly in your browser!

Hi, I’m Terry, maintainer of https://github.com/terryds/awesome-strudel repository on Github, which contains a collection of popular song covers, tutorials and other resources in Strudel.

As a self-taught programmer, I believe learning music should be as accessible as learning programming now (thanks to the power of internet & computer).

I started my programming journey when I was a kid with just internet resources & PC in a small city of Indonesia. I started just by going through W3School tutorial and tweaking HTML on their HTML Test Bed. It felt so good that you can start to make something, just by typing something in the browser.

I didn’t have the chance to learn music because we didn’t have any instruments at home, and music course were just expensive.

But, now, things have changed. Thanks to [strudel.cc](http://strudel.cc) , learning music can be done directly in the browser. Everybody can learn music with only internet browser.

I’m creating this free guide to help beginner learn how to make music, from theory to practice directly in browser, using [Strudel.cc](http://Strudel.cc)
