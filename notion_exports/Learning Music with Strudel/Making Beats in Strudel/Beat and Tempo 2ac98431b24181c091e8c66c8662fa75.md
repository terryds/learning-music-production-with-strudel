# Beat and Tempo

## **What's a "beat?"**

People commonly use the word "beat" to mean "a pattern (or *rhythm*) played by drums." The thing you're making when you create and play patterns in these lessons is "a beat."

But, confusingly, there's another use of the word "beat," which means "a regular, repeating pulse that underlies a musical pattern." People tap their foot along with "the beat" in this context.

## Tempo

The speed at which your patterns play back is called the *tempo*. Tempo is measured in *beats per minute* or *BPM*. So if we talk about a piece of music being "at 120 BPM," we mean that there are 120 beats (pulses) every minute.

Some types of musical patterns have a very clear underlying beat, while others have a more subtle or implied one

To hear a steady beat, add notes on the Kick line at the positions labeled 1, 5, 9, and 13.

This pattern is so common that it even has its own name: **"four on the floor."**

Now try adding some notes for open-hat, closed-hat, and clap, but leave the Kick row alone. Notice that no matter what you do in the other rows, the steady pattern in the Kick line makes it really hard to lose the sense of clear pulse.

## Visualizing Beats in Strudel

Tips: You can visualize the beats using _punchcard() and .color to add the color

## Challenge: Simplifying Notation

In Strudel, you can write the music above with a more simplified notation

Read this recap from Strudel if you want to familiarize with the notation

[Strudel**Recap 🚀 Strudel**](https://strudel.cc/workshop/recap/)

Challenge: Write the previous beat with `:` (replicate) notation, and without writing the same thing again 4x.

Hint: configure the `setcpm`

    Play this and listen to the previous one, it sounds the same but the syntax here is shorter.
    
    However, we will stick with the standard **four beats per cycle** to make it easier to understand
